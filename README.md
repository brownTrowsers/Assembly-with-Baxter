# Assembly-with-Baxter
Mechatronics final year project repo: Assembly using the Baxter robot with ROS.

This repository contains scripts for moving the manipulators via position and velocity control, aswell as controllers for the grippers.
The scripts for manipulator control are found in the assembly_movement package.

The grippers used in the project were the BH8-282 BarretHand and the RobotIQ 2F-85.
